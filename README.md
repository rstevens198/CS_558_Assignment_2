List/description of novel/significant design decisions
  Since this program is small we just initualzed at the top then the next few lines are the meat of the code and finally the end is for printing and displaying the results.

List/description of any extra features/algorithms/functionality 
  none

List/description of any known deficiencies or bugs
  So far there are no known bugs. 

Lessons Learned 
  We learned abour python and scipy. Having never used scipy and very little python that was the biggest learning curve in this program.
